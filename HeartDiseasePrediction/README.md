Predicting Heart Disease
==============================
This project is a warmup exercise for applying machine learning skills in the real world. We use dataset from a study of heart disease that has been open to the public for many years. The study collected various measurements on patient health and cardiovascular statistics, and makes patient identities anonymous. The dataset was downloaded from drivendata.org competition page. In this project we will predict whether a patient has the heart diseases or not based on 13 different features from the data.
